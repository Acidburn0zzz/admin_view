# admin_view

Rails 4 generator of CRUD admin controllers, views and specs for existing ActiveRecord models.

It uses [ransack](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack) for search and [kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari) for pagination.

The produced markup in views is compatible with [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com).

## Usage

Include it in your Gemfile:

	gem "admin_view"

Run the generator:

	$ bundle exec rails g admin_view User --search_by name_or_email

The `--search_by` option is not required. However, it's useful most of the time, and you can use any ransack-compatible expression to search in string or text fields.

Other options available are:

* `--no_create` - omit functionality to create a new record
* `--read_only` - omit create, edit and update functionality
